# Lotus

A template engine for writing human-friendly HTML.

## Goals

The goal is to create a small, simple tool that makes HTML coding more accessible and a delight for developers of any skill level and ensure it is:

- Beautiful;
- Well-Indented;
- Clear;
- ðŸª· _Without stress._

### Getting Started

Lotus is in its early stages. Thus, it has yet to be available for package managers.

However, you can still get your hands dirty by cloning our project directly:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/luxonauta/lotus.git
cd lotus
```

I set up a simple `index.js` as a starting point. Here's how you can try it:

- Within the project directory, locate `index.js`.
- Open it in your editor and adjust the `template` to test different HTML structures in the Lotus format.
- Run the script via Node.js to see the magic happen:

```sh
node index.js
```

> The output in your console is the Lotus engine's interpretation of your input, transformed into standard HTML.
